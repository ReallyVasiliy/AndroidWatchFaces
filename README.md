## AndroidWatchFaces

A conversation with someone got me curious about using OpenGL for Android Wear watchfaces, so I wrote a sample or two based on some graphics code kicking around. 

The OpenGL is ported from some existing WebGL code. JavaScript to Java?! I know right. Still in the process of filling out it. It's done enough right now to support the required functions on the watchfaces. 

### Watch Faces
- SpringMesh - Spring mesh simulation. Responds to accelorometer.
- Fluids2D - 2D fluids simulation. Responds to accelorometer.
- Particles (not finished)

### Building
Project files are Android Studio 1.1. 

### License
License is BSD/MIT/Boost. 

Have fun.
