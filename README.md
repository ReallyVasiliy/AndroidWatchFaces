## AndroidWatchFaces

A conversation with someone made me curious about using OpenGL for watch face, so I wrote a sample or two based on some graphics code kicking around. 

The OpenGL is ported from some existing WebGL code. Still in the process of filling out it. It's done enough right now to support the require functions on the watch faces. 

### Watch Faces
- SpringMesh
- Fluids2D
- Particles (not finished)

Have fun.
