## AndroidWatchFaces

A conversation with someone got me curious about using OpenGL for Android Wear watchfaces, so I wrote a sample or two using some graphics code I had laying around. 

The OpenGL is ported from some existing WebGL code. JavaScript to Java?! I know right. Still in the process of filling out it. It's done enough right now to support the required functions on the watchfaces. 

### Watch Faces
##### SpringMesh
Spring mesh simulation. Responds to accelorometer. Looks similar to the screenshot below. Will get real screenshot soon.
